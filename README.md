# Breast-Cancer-Machine-Learning
Using a machine learning algorithm with data describing breast cancer cells to determine if a tumor is malignant or benign.

In the R file, I use graphing and other techniques to visualize a large dataset containing information about different tumors. 
In the python file, I use a different dataset to train a machine learning algorithm to decide if breast cancer cells are benign or malignant based on certain properties.
